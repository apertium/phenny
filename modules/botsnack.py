botsnack.py - .botsnack module (aka simulated hunger 1.0)
author: mutantmonkey <mutantmonkey@mutantmonkey.in>
author: Casey Link <unnamedrambler@gmail.com>

This module simulates bot hunger and provides a mechanism
for users to feed the bot.

To prevent abuse when the bot gets very, very full, it explodes
and enters a random cooldown period for 3-10 minutes. When in this
cooldown period all calls to botsnack are ignored.
